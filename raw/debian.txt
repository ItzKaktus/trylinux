NOTE: Debian is Ubuntu's base, so they are pretty similar.
NOTE: No Derivatives such as Kali Linux or Ubuntu will be here! For Ubuntu and its derivatives, go to ubuntu.txt.
NOTE: Debian GNU/Hurd will not be shown here, as it is not GNU/Linux.
WARNING: Going into Debian's FTP servers alone can make you pretty confused what to pick, but here, we've done that for you!
