## Acquire an installation image
Visit the Download page and acquire the ISO file.
## Prepare an installation medium
The installation image can be supplied to the target machine via a USB flash drive or an optical disc with popsicle-gtk or Xfburn on Linux, or with Rufus or PowerISO on Windows.
## Verify the boot mode
To verify the boot mode, list the efivars directory:

# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

If the command shows the directory without error, then the system is booted in UEFI mode. If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in BIOS or UEFI-CSM mode. If the system did not boot in the mode you desired, refer to your motherboard's manual. 
## Connect to the internet
To set up a network connection in the live environment, go through the following steps:
### Ensure your network interface is listed and enabled, for example with ip-link(8):

# ip link

### For wireless and WWAN, make sure the card is not blocked with rfkill.

### Connect to the network:
#### Ethernet: plug in the cable.
#### Wi-Fi: authenticate to the wireless network using iwctl.
#### Mobile broadband modem: connect to the mobile network with the mmcli utility.
### Configure your network connection:
#### DHCP: dynamic IP address and DNS server assignment should work out of the box for Ethernet, WLAN and WWAN network interfaces.
#### Static IP address: follow https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration#Static_IP_address.
### The connection may be verified with ping:

# ping github.com

## Update the system clock
### Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:
# timedatectl set-ntp true
###To check the service status, use timedatectl status.
